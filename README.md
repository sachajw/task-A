# task-A

## Language
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* OS [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/)

## Requirements
* Implement the sort method on a class that performs a bubble sort algorithm on a given, unsorted array, argument.
* Write unit tests to make sure it works.
* Account for the constraints given below.
* Add a static code analyzer or code formatter to test for complexity and style guideline adherence.

## Constraints
* Arrays of 10 000 elements are not allowed to be processed by your bubble sort implementation.
* Assume the unsorted array contains only integers and possible null values (which you should remove).
* If the array contains nested arrays, flatten the array before sorting.

Example of the unsorted array argument and the output result:
[6, 2, [4, 3],[[[5], nil], 1]]
[6, 2, [4, 3],[[[5], nil], 1]]
should be sorted (using bubble sort algorithm) to
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

## Bubble Sort
Lets describe the Python file bubble-sort.py.

* I use the ```bash``` terminal in ```Ubuntu 20.04```.
* In order to test the algorythm change into the ```app``` directory and run ```python3 bubble-sort.py``` in your terminal.
